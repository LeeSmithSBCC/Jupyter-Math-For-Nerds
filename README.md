### Amazingly SOME Math students do not like COMPUTER SCIENCE ?!?!

#### I have created a number of very simple Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate College Math solutions:
 - Algebra
 - Analytic Geometry
 - Trigonometry
 - Plotting
 - Derivatives
 - Calculus
 - Series and Limits
 - Linear Analysis [coming soon]
 - ODE and PDE [differential equations], a work in progress
 
 #### If you have not installed Anaconda on your computer, there is a PDF of each Notebook
 ### The Jupiter-Files FOLDER has Jupyter Notebook files [.ipynb extension]
